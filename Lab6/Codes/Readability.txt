Readability of source code
In computer programming, readability refers to the 
ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and 
operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including 
portability, usability and most importantly maintainability. Readability is 
important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying 
to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source 
code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. 
A study found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter 
and drastically reduced the time to understand it. Following a consistent 
programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than 
just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the 
ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute 
to readability. Some of these factors include different indentation styles 
(whitespace), comments, decomposition, naming conventions for objects (such as 
variables, classes, procedures, etc.)
