	This is my 1st time to hear something about data mining.
    Data   mining   is the process of extracting patterns from data. 
Data mining is seen as an increasingly important tool by modern business to transform data into business intelligence giving an informational advantage. 
It is currently used in a wide range of profiling practices, 
such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection, and scientific discovery.
